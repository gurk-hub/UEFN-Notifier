# UEFN-Notifier

Pushing changes in UEFN can take a while, and you might start doing something else while waiting—browsing websites, working on assets, or making dinner. Wouldn't it be great if a sound played when your changes finished pushing?

Well fear no more - UEFN Notifier is here with a solution that will save you time!

## Features

- Plays a sound when changes are pushed  
- Detects success and failure  
- Allows choosing your own notification sounds  
- Option to launch on Windows startup  
- One-click install and use  
- Lightweight with very low resource usage  

## Usage

1. Move the `uefn_notifier.exe` file to a safe location (e.g., your Documents folder).  
2. Open the program. It will show a notification and run in your system tray.  
3. Right-click the system tray icon to access options, check status, and view last detection times.  

That's it—simple and effective!

## Known Issues

- On some systems, the file explorer may not open properly when selecting a new sound file. Double-clicking the sound file should still work.  
- Permission errors may occur if your antivirus blocks the program.  
- The sound sometimes plays a bit early, before Fortnite has fully loaded.  
- When launched on startup, the command prompt window may remain visible.
